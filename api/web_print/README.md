# Web Print

The [My MakerBot](https://www.makerbot.com/media-center/2017/06/25/education-cloud-my-makerbot-educators-guidebook) website allows passing an .stl file url in 
order to print on your MakerBot printer.  This simple integration allows 
you to send a user to My MakerBot where the file 
can be cloud sliced and sent to their printer all within a web browser and 
doesn't require installing any software.

All you need to do is have the user click a link like this:
